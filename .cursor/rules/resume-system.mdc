# Resume System Conventions

## File Roles

- `portfolio/master-portfolio.yaml` — Single source of truth for career history. Update when roles, responsibilities, or metrics change.
- `portfolio/skill-taxonomy.yaml` — Normalized skill database. Update proficiency levels and evidence as skills grow.
- `portfolio/questionnaire.yaml` — Expansion prompts. Mark as `answered` with a `response` when filled. Never delete questions.
- `templates/resume-standards.md` — Global formatting rules. Rarely changes.
- `templates/structures/*.yaml` — Role-specific resume structures. Add new files for new role types.
- `archive/` — Raw unstructured material. Drop files here; reference them but don't modify originals.
- `output/` — Generated resumes. Naming: `resume-{company}-{role}-{date}.md`

## When Editing the Taxonomy

- Use exact proficiency levels: `expert`, `advanced`, `intermediate`, `foundational`
- Always include at least one evidence bullet per skill
- Tag applicable roles using the role structure filenames (e.g., `data-engineer`, `analytics-engineer`)
- Mark uncertainty with `# TODO:` comments inside evidence arrays

## When Generating Resumes

- Always read all four inputs: portfolio, taxonomy, role structure, and standards
- Filter taxonomy skills to those applicable to the target role
- Never fabricate metrics — use scale indicators when numbers aren't available
- Include a `<!-- GENERATION NOTES -->` block with gap analysis
- Output to `output/` with the standard naming convention

## When Adding New Roles

1. Create `templates/structures/{role-name}.yaml`
2. Follow the existing structure format (summary_focus, skill_category_priority, experience_bullet_emphasis, keyword_targets)
3. Add the role name to `applicable_roles` in relevant taxonomy skills

## When Processing Archive Material

- Extract skills, metrics, and evidence into taxonomy and portfolio
- Cross-reference against questionnaire for matching unanswered questions
- Never modify files in `archive/` — they are read-only source material

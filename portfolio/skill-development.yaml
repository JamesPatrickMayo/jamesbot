# ============================================================================
# SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRACKER — [YOUR NAME]
# Tracks capability gaps, articulation gaps, and interview prep.
# Grounded in recurring patterns from fit evaluations.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   1. After each fit evaluation, add any new MODERATE+ gaps to this file.
#   2. Update 'status' as you work through each skill.
#   3. Review 'roadmap.current_sprint' weekly and update the deadline.
#   4. 'confidence' is self-assessed for INTERVIEWS — separate from actual capability.
#      A skill can be 'advanced' in taxonomy but 'low' confidence in interviews.
#
# STATUS VALUES: not_started | in_progress | comfortable | strong
# GAP TYPES:
#   capability   — need to actually build/deepen the skill
#   articulation — can do it, but can't explain it clearly under interview pressure
#   both         — gap in both doing and explaining

# SECTION 5: INTEGRATION WITH FIT EVALUATIONS
# When a new fit evaluation surfaces a gap, add it here.
# ============================================================================

gap_tracking_log:
  instructions: >
    After each fit evaluation, check the GAP ANALYSIS section.
    For any MODERATE GAP or recurring PARTIAL MATCH:
    - If the skill already exists here: note the new eval in 'surfaced_in_evals'
    - If the skill is new: add a new entry in the appropriate priority tier
    This keeps the roadmap grounded in real application patterns, not speculation.

      source_evals: ["[Company 1]", "[Company 2]"]

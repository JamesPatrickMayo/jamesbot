# Schema per paragraph:
#   scenario:         Short identifier for this paragraph's use case
#   description:      When to use this paragraph
#   tags:             Keyword tags for JD matching
#   applicable_roles: Role slugs where this paragraph is most relevant (empty = all)
#   text:             The actual paragraph text (first-person, conversational)

  # --- Opening / Hook paragraphs -------------------------------------------

  - scenario: opening_implementation_sa
    description: >
      Opening for implementation or SA roles where the core motion maps directly
      to QuotaPath SE work (client onboarding, integration scoping, deployment).
    tags: [implementation, onboarding, client_facing, solutions_engineer, saas, integration]
    applicable_roles: [solutions-engineer]
    text: >
      After leading 300+ client implementations at QuotaPath — spanning CRM, payroll,
      and financial integrations across Salesforce, HubSpot, ADP, and NetSuite — I know
      what makes an onboarding succeed and what makes it stall. It's rarely the technical
      complexity. It's whether the implementation team can bridge the gap between what
      clients think they need and what their data can actually support. That's the work
      I've spent the last year doing every day, and it's exactly what your role describes.

  - scenario: opening_data_engineering
    description: >
      Opening for data engineering roles where the dbt / pipeline credential is the primary
      hook and build-from-scratch experience is relevant.
    tags: [data_engineering, dbt, pipeline, analytics_engineering, build_from_scratch]
    applicable_roles: [data-engineer, analytics-engineer]
    text: >
      I've spent the past three years in the kind of data environments most engineers
      encounter once: a 1,900-model dbt project with no catalog, inconsistent tests,
      and a migration from three different tools in flight simultaneously. At Success
      Academy I built the quality function from scratch — defined the standards,
      audited every model, and stood up a 3-tier dev/stage/prod architecture on AWS.
      At QuotaPath I built ELT pipelines for TB-scale customer data across 10+
      integration platforms. That combination of precision and scale is what I'm
      looking to bring to your team.

  - scenario: opening_platform_architect
    description: >
      Opening for platform or staff-level engineering roles where architecture and
      systems thinking is the primary qualification.
    tags: [architecture, platform, data_platform, staff_engineer, infrastructure]
    applicable_roles: [platform-architect]
    text: >
      The systems I've built over the past seven years have a consistent thread: they
      were designed for the team, not just the immediate ticket. At QuotaPath, that
      meant a Medallion-architecture Snowflake warehouse with CI/CD and dbt models
      that any engineer could pick up. At Success Academy, it meant a 3-tier AWS
      environment with Redshift, documented lineage for 90+ pipelines, and a dbt
      project audited down to the last orphaned model. I don't just build — I build
      things that scale and explain themselves.

  - scenario: opening_integration_engineer
    description: >
      Opening for integration engineering roles emphasizing API work,
      system connectivity, and cross-platform data flow.
    tags: [integration, api, rest, webhook, data_pipeline, connector, saas]
    applicable_roles: [solutions-engineer, data-engineer]
    text: >
      Integration work is where I'm most at home. At QuotaPath, I connected 10+
      platforms — Salesforce, HubSpot, ADP, NetSuite, Stripe, QuickBooks, and
      more — into scalable ELT pipelines, handling everything from API
      authentication to schema drift to the edge cases clients discover on day
      one of go-live. I've scoped integrations with engineering teams, debugged
      production issues at 11pm, and written the runbook so the next engineer
      doesn't have to. That end-to-end ownership is what I bring.

  # --- Middle / Credential paragraphs --------------------------------------

  - scenario: client_facing_scale
    description: >
      Body paragraph highlighting the 300+ implementations credential and the SE
      motion at QuotaPath. Use when client volume, scale, or end-to-end ownership
      is a key requirement.
    tags: [client_facing, scale, implementation, onboarding, project_management, delivery]
    applicable_roles: [solutions-engineer]
    text: >
      At QuotaPath I managed 300+ concurrent client implementations, prioritized
      by ARR and account complexity. Each engagement required scoping the integration
      architecture, assessing the client's data fitness, communicating constraints
      to non-technical stakeholders, and then building the actual pipeline —
      sometimes the same day. That combination of technical depth and client-facing
      communication, compressed into a high-volume environment, is the credential
      I'd put against any implementation role.

  - scenario: build_from_scratch
    description: >
      Body paragraph for roles that value greenfield experience, ownership, or
      the ability to create process where none exists (startup, founding, first hire).
    tags: [build_from_scratch, greenfield, ownership, startup, founding, process_creation]
    applicable_roles: [data-engineer, analytics-engineer, platform-architect, solutions-engineer]
    text: >
      I tend to find the greenfield work most energizing. At Success Academy, the data
      quality function didn't exist when I joined — I created the QA process, the
      testing standards, the governance documentation, and the on-call escalation
      playbook from scratch. At QuotaPath, I built the AI-assisted scoping workflow,
      the Python migration framework, and the standardized onboarding toolkit before
      any of them existed. I'm not the kind of engineer who needs a detailed spec
      to get started. I identify the gap, propose the solution, and ship it.

  - scenario: dbt_data_quality_credential
    description: >
      Body paragraph emphasizing the dbt expertise and data quality track record.
      Use for analytics engineering, data engineering, or roles requiring strong
      dbt and data modeling credentials.
    tags: [dbt, data_quality, analytics_engineering, sql, data_modeling, testing]
    applicable_roles: [data-engineer, analytics-engineer, platform-architect]
    text: >
      My strongest credential in this space is the dbt work at Success Academy:
      1,900+ models audited, documented, and tested; a Raw → Staging → Analytics
      layer structure I designed from scratch; and data incident reduction of 50%+
      after we standardized testing across the catalog. That level of dbt fluency —
      not just writing models, but owning the architecture, the governance, and the
      migration from legacy tools — is what I'd bring on day one.

  - scenario: domain_gap_bridge
    description: >
      Body paragraph for roles where the domain is new (healthcare, HR tech, fintech)
      but the technical skills transfer directly. Acknowledges the gap honestly and
      frames the candidate's learning trajectory.
    tags: [domain_gap, transferable_skills, learning, adaptability, new_domain]
    applicable_roles: [solutions-engineer, data-engineer, analytics-engineer]
    text: >
      I'll be direct: the [DOMAIN] space is newer territory for me than the
      technical stack. But the integration work, the data quality standards, and
      the client-facing delivery motion are not. I've ramped on new domains quickly
      before — GDPR compliance requirements at Cision, commission plan structures
      at QuotaPath — and I approach new domain knowledge the same way I approach
      a new codebase: read everything, ask good questions, and build a mental model
      before I touch anything. I'd rather start one quarter behind on domain
      terminology than three years behind on the technical fundamentals.

  # --- Closing paragraphs --------------------------------------------------

  - scenario: closing_why_this_company
    description: >
      Generic closing that invites substitution of company-specific details.
      LLM should fill in [COMPANY] and [SPECIFIC_REASON] from JD context.
    tags: [closing, why_company, culture_fit, motivation]
    applicable_roles: []
    text: >
      What draws me to [COMPANY] specifically is [SPECIFIC_REASON]. I'd welcome the
      chance to discuss how my background maps to what you're building. Happy to do
      a technical screen, walk through a system design, or just talk through the role
      in more detail — whatever's most useful for you.

  - scenario: closing_startup_energy
    description: >
      Closing for startup or early-stage roles emphasizing scrappiness,
      speed, and ownership mindset.
    tags: [startup, early_stage, founding, ownership, adaptability, fast_paced]
    applicable_roles: [solutions-engineer, data-engineer]
    text: >
      The fast-paced, building-something-real energy of [COMPANY] is exactly the kind
      of environment I do my best work in. I move quickly, ask for forgiveness not
      permission when the path is clear, and hold a high bar for quality even when
      the timeline is tight. I'd love to bring that to your team.

  - scenario: closing_mission_driven
    description: >
      Closing for mission-driven organizations (healthcare, education, nonprofit-adjacent).
      Acknowledges the mission as a genuine motivator.
    tags: [mission_driven, healthcare, education, impact, purpose]
    applicable_roles: []
    text: >
      The mission matters to me. I spent two years at Success Academy — a 51-school
      public charter network — and the work felt different when the data I was
      maintaining connected back to real kids and real outcomes. [COMPANY]'s focus
      on [MISSION] has that same quality, and it's a meaningful part of why I'm
      applying here specifically rather than to a generic engineering role.

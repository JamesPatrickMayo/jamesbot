headline:
  current: "Solutions Engineer | Data Integrations, ETL Pipelines, and Cross-Functional Systems Delivery"
  issues:
    - "Only signals one role type (Solutions Engineer)"
    - "Doesn't mention dbt, data quality, or analytics engineering — strongest differentiators"
    - "Doesn't signal breadth across the skill clusters mapped in career-strategy.yaml"
    - "'Cross-Functional Systems Delivery' is vague and not a searchable keyword"

  suggested_options:
    - option: "Data Engineer & Solutions Engineer | dbt, ELT Pipelines, Data Quality | Building Data Systems from Scratch"
      rationale: "Covers two primary role clusters. 'from scratch' is the core narrative differentiator."
      character_count: 97

    - option: "Data & Solutions Engineer | dbt Expert, ELT Pipelines, CRM Integration, Data Quality Automation"
      rationale: "Keyword-dense for recruiter search. Covers 3 skill clusters in one line."
      character_count: 94

    - option: "Solutions Engineer & Analytics Engineer | dbt, Data Quality, CRM Integration | Open to New Opportunities"
      rationale: "Explicitly signals job search. Covers client-facing + data engineering clusters."

  guidance: >
    The headline is the single most important SEO element on LinkedIn. Recruiters
    search by keywords in this field. Include the 2-3 most common role titles you
    want to be found for, plus 2-3 technical keywords that differentiate you.
    Avoid generic phrases like 'cross-functional delivery' that no recruiter
    searches for.

    I build data systems from the ground up. At Success Academy Charter Schools, I joined a team with no formal quality process, was promoted within months to lead the function, and built the entire data quality practice from scratch: testing standards, automated monitoring, observability workflows, and a dbt environment that grew to 1,900+ production models serving 51 schools and 18,000 users.

    At QuotaPath, I designed ELT pipelines integrating data from 10+ CRM and financial platforms into Snowflake, built data validation frameworks that cut incidents by over 50%, and migrated batch processing from row-by-row SQL to parallelized Python transformations using Dask, reducing runtimes from hours to minutes.

    What I do best:
    - Data engineering: SQL, Python, dbt (expert-level, 1,900+ models), Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
    - Pipeline design: ELT/ETL architecture, Medallion layers, CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, CircleCI)
    - Data quality: Validation frameworks, automated testing, freshness/schema monitoring, governance documentation
    - Solutions engineering: 300+ client onboardings/year, CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot), prospect scoping
    - Tools: Airbyte, Looker, Sisense, Power BI, Jira, Confluence, Jupyter, DBeaver, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude

    I'm currently exploring new opportunities in data engineering, solutions engineering, analytics engineering, and related roles. Open to both full-time and contract engagements.

  guidance: >
    The About section should tell the 'build from scratch' story in 2-3 short
    paragraphs, followed by a keyword-rich skills summary. End with what you're
    looking for and how to contact you. Write in first person. Avoid buzzwords.
    Use the same direct, matter-of-fact tone from your cover letters.

    issues:
      - "Title doesn't reflect promotion trajectory (QA Tech → QA Lead → Team Lead)"
      - "Bullets are dense but miss the 'created from scratch' narrative"
      - "No mention of team size managed, schools served, users impacted in the opening"
      - "Formatting uses hyphens instead of proper bullet points"

    suggested_title: "Team Lead, Data Quality | Analytics Engineer"
    suggested_description: |
      Joined as a QA Tech, promoted within months to QA Lead, then to Team Lead managing 2 direct reports.

      - "Missing mention of specific tech: Cassandra, ElasticSearch"

  - company: "Cision / Trendkite (Enterprise Account Architect)"
    issues:
      - "Missing the promotion from Account Architect → Enterprise Account Architect"
      - "The two Cision entries (Account Architect + Enterprise Account Architect) should ideally show as one role with a promotion"
    suggested_change: >
      Merge the Account Architect (Oct 2018 - Apr 2019) and Enterprise Account
      Architect (Apr 2019 - Dec 2019) into a single entry showing the promotion.
      LinkedIn supports showing title changes within one company entry.

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # EARLIER ROLES (ECP, Sage, Kinsmen)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - company: "Earlier roles"
    guidance: >
      These are fine as-is for historical context. ECP is worth keeping because
      5 years of client-facing technical problem-solving supports the Solutions
      Engineer narrative. Sage and Kinsmen can remain minimal.

      LinkedIn's Featured section appears at the top of your profile. Use it
      to showcase 2-3 items that demonstrate your work.
    suggestions:
      - type: "Link or document"
        content: "A blog post or writeup about building data quality from scratch at Success Academy"
        why: "Unique narrative. Very few candidates have this story."

        content: "GitHub profile or a public project repo"
        why: "Shows active technical work."
      - type: "Post"
        content: "A LinkedIn post about a technical topic you have strong opinions on (e.g., dbt testing patterns, data quality automation)"

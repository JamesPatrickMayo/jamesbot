# 1. CAREER IDENTITY
# ============================================================================
career_identity:

  core_narrative: >
    Technical systems leader focused on scalable data infrastructure,
    integration, and automation. Strongest at the intersection of data
    engineering and solutions engineering: building pipelines, onboarding
    complex integrations, and translating ambiguous requirements into
    production systems.

  key_differentiators:
    - "Build-from-scratch credibility: stood up data quality, QA processes, and dbt environments from zero at two companies"
    - "Client-facing technical depth: 300+ onboardings/year, scoping with prospects, translating requirements into pipelines"
    - "dbt expert at scale: 1,900+ production models, testing standards, documentation"
    - "ELT pipeline design across CRM, financial, and operational data sources"
    - "AI-augmented workflow: Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude used daily for modeling, documentation, and scaffolding"

  work_style_preferences:
    # Sourced from Career Interest Evaluation
    autonomy: "High. Needs documented constraints, not micromanagement. Dislikes autonomy as a substitute for resourcing."
    learning: "Engaged when mastery is required, but expects funded/supported learning, not 'figure it out' culture."
    hierarchy: "Comfortable with hierarchy when technical judgment is respected. Disengages when decisions override evidence."
    pace: "Prefers slow improvement over constant urgency. Needs time allocated for system hardening."
    ownership: "Prefers clear ownership boundaries. Disengages when ambiguity extends to ownership (who owns what)."
    interruptions: "Works best with predictable interruption patterns. Can context-switch if domains are related."
    sustainability: "Ambiguous success metrics and urgency without system improvement are burnout triggers."

  interview_profile:
    strengths:
      - "Case studies and take-home assignments (can prepare, demonstrate real thinking)"
      - "Technical discussion and architecture walkthroughs"
      - "Client-facing scenarios and stakeholder communication questions"
    weaknesses:
      - "Leetcode-style live coding (feels like performing under artificial pressure)"
    mitigation: >
      Prioritize companies that use case studies, take-homes, or system design
      interviews over pure algorithm grinding. When leetcode is unavoidable,
      practice top 50 patterns in SQL and Python (not 500 problems).
    compensation_approach: >
      Confirm alignment with posted/shared ranges rather than anchoring to a
      specific number. Negotiate after offer, not during screening.


# ============================================================================
# 2. DUAL-TRACK STRATEGY
# ============================================================================
dual_track:

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # TRACK A: Full-Time Employment
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  track_a_fte:
    priority: "Primary stability track"
    description: >
      Secure a full-time role at a company where the 'build from scratch'
      narrative and cross-functional breadth are valued. Optimize for learning
      environment, clear ownership, and mission alignment.

    target_org_profile:
      size: "50-500 employees (sweet spot based on application data)"
      stage: "Series A through Series D / growth-stage"
      rationale: >
        100% of 7.5+ fit scores came from startups/growth-stage companies.
        At this size, James's breadth (data eng + solutions eng + client-facing)
        is an asset rather than a 'doesn't fit one box' liability.
      exceptions: >
        Established companies are worth evaluating if: (a) the role is on a
        small, autonomous team within the larger org, or (b) the JD explicitly
        values build-from-scratch experience over deep specialization.

    domain_preferences:
      tier_1:
        - "Data infrastructure / modern data stack (dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery)"
        - "API integration platforms"
        - "SaaS RevOps / financial data"
      tier_2:
        - "Health tech (data engineering focus, not clinical)"
        - "Education technology"
        - "Developer tools"
      tier_3_mission_driven:
        - "Civic tech and government data"
        - "Climate data and sustainability"
        - "Nonprofit data infrastructure"
        - "Open data / data-for-good organizations"
      note: >
        Mission-driven roles are actively sought, not just a nice-to-have.
        Apply the same fit score threshold (7.5+) but weight mission alignment
        as a tie-breaker between otherwise equivalent opportunities.

    geographic_preferences:
      - "New York City (on-site or hybrid)"
      - "Remote (US-based)"

    compensation: "Confirm alignment with range. Negotiate after offer."

  # Roles to deprioritize (not avoid entirely — evaluate case-by-case)
  deprioritize:
    description: >
      These titles have weak transferable skill overlap or require deep
      specialization that would take 6+ months to develop. Evaluate
      individual JDs rather than blanket-skipping.
    titles:

        reason: "No ML production experience. Foundational-only in experiment design."
      - title: "Backend Engineer / Full Stack Engineer"

# 4. LINKEDIN OPTIMIZATION
# ============================================================================
linkedin:

  open_to_work_titles:
    description: >
      LinkedIn allows 5 titles for 'Open to Work'. These should maximize
      coverage across the skill clusters, not just the most obvious titles.
      The 5 slots should span different clusters to cast a wide net for
      recruiter inbound.
    current_selection:
      - title: "Solutions Engineer"
        cluster: "Client-Facing Technical Delivery"
        rationale: "Highest-volume recruiter searches for this skill profile."
      - title: "Data Engineer"
        cluster: "Data Infrastructure & Pipelines"
        rationale: "Broadest technical title. Surfaces data infra, pipeline, and platform roles."
      - title: "Analytics Engineer"
        cluster: "Data Infrastructure + BI"
        rationale: "dbt-specific roles often search this title. Growing demand."
      - title: "Revenue Operations Engineer"
        cluster: "Revenue Operations & CRM"
        rationale: "Opens a new category of roles not covered by the other 4 titles."
      - title: "Technical Program Manager"
        cluster: "Technical Leadership"

    Review Open to Work titles monthly. Track which titles generate recruiter
    inbound. If a title produces zero relevant contacts after 4 weeks, swap it
    for another title from a DIFFERENT cluster to maintain breadth. The goal
    is to always have at least 3 distinct skill clusters represented in the
    5 slots.

    note: "Competition-Adjusted Score = Base Fit + Recency Modifier + Competition Modifier"

  mission_driven_modifier: >
    For roles at mission-driven organizations (civic tech, climate, education,
    nonprofit), add +0.5 to the base fit score before competition adjustment.
    This reflects the additional motivation and cultural alignment.

  contract_evaluation:
    must_meet_all:
      - "Rate >= $60/hr"
      - "Duration >= 1 month"
      - "Uses at least one skill from Tier 1 roles"
    strong_if:
      - "Fills a gap in the skill taxonomy (e.g., Airflow, streaming)"
      - "Produces a portfolio-ready case study"
      - "Is at a mission-driven organization"
      - "Rate >= $75/hr"

  interview_format_preference:
    prefer: "Case study, take-home, system design, architecture walkthrough"
    acceptable: "SQL live coding, technical discussion"
    avoid_if_possible: "Leetcode-style algorithmic interviews"
    note: >
      If a company's interview process is known to be leetcode-heavy
      (e.g., FAANG-style), factor this into the decision to apply.
      A 7.5 fit score at a leetcode-heavy company may have lower expected
      value than a 7.0 at a case-study company.


# ============================================================================
# 6. SKILL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
# ============================================================================
skill_development:

  rationale: >
    Priorities derived from recurring gaps across 13 job applications.
    Ordered by frequency of appearance in JDs that scored 6+ and practical
    learnability within the next 3 months.

  high_priority:
    - skill: "Airflow / Dagster"
      current_level: "foundational"
      target_level: "intermediate"
      gap_frequency: "Appeared in J2 Health, Trovo Health, and multiple skipped JDs"
      action: "Take a contract project using Dagster or Airflow. Or build a personal project with Dagster."
      timeline: "Next 1-3 months"

    - skill: "Advanced AWS (Lambda hands-on, Step Functions authoring)"
      current_level: "intermediate (Lambda), foundational (Step Functions)"
      target_level: "intermediate+ for both"
      gap_frequency: "AWS depth appeared in most Data Engineer JDs"
      action: "Build a Lambda-based ingestion pipeline for a personal or contract project. Author at least one Step Functions workflow."
      timeline: "Next 2-4 months"

    - skill: "TypeScript / Node.js basics"
      current_level: "none"
      target_level: "foundational"
      gap_frequency: "Appeared in Maven Clinic, Merge, several integration roles"
      action: "Complete a short TypeScript fundamentals course. Build one API integration in TS."
      timeline: "Next 2-3 months"

  medium_priority:
    - skill: "OAuth / SAML / SSO concepts"
      current_level: "none"
      target_level: "foundational"
      gap_frequency: "Appeared in Maven Clinic, several SA roles"
      action: "Read through OAuth 2.0 and SAML flows. Implement one OAuth integration."

    - skill: "Spark / Databricks basics"
      current_level: "none"
      target_level: "foundational"
      gap_frequency: "Required for most large-company data engineer roles"
      action: "Databricks Community Edition free tier. Complete Spark fundamentals module."
      note: "Lower priority because large-company roles score poorly anyway."

  low_priority:
    - skill: "Streaming / Kafka / Kinesis"
      current_level: "foundational (zero production)"
      target_level: "foundational+"
      action: "Only pursue if a contract opportunity arises. Don't study speculatively."

  leetcode_strategy:
    approach: >
      Do not grind 500 problems. Focus on SQL problems (already strong) and
      the top 30 Python patterns (arrays, hashmaps, two pointers, sliding window).
      Practice 2-3 problems per week, max 30 minutes each. The goal is damage
      control, not mastery. Prioritize companies with case-study interviews.
    resources:
      - "NeetCode 150 (Python subset)"
      - "DataLemur SQL questions"
      - "StrataScratch (data-focused SQL + Python)"

# 7. SEARCH CADENCE & TRACKING
# ============================================================================
search_cadence:

  daily:
    - "LinkedIn Jobs: check alerts for all 11 titles"
    - "Respond to any recruiter inbound within 24 hours"

  every_2_3_days:
    - "Google ATS board search (Primary + Expanded queries from search-strategy.yaml)"
    - "Check contract platforms (Toptal, A.Team) for new data/analytics gigs"

  weekly:
    - "Built In NYC: browse new listings"
    - "Wellfound: browse new listings"
    - "Review all applications submitted this week: track response rates"
    - "Update career-strategy.yaml if market signals shift (e.g., new title trending, domain cooling)"

  monthly:
    - "Hacker News Who's Hiring thread (1st of month)"
    - "Review LinkedIn Open to Work titles: rotate underperformers"
    - "Review contract platform profiles: update with new skills/evidence"
    - "Audit fit score patterns: are thresholds calibrated correctly?"

  quarterly:
    - "Run full skill taxonomy audit against recent JDs"
    - "Update master-portfolio.yaml with any new contract/project experience"
    - "Re-evaluate dual-track balance: is FTE or contract generating better results?"

# 8. APPLICATION HISTORY & OBSERVATIONS
# ============================================================================
application_history:

  as_of: "2026-02-20"
  total_evaluated: 0  # Update with your own count
  full_applications_generated: 0  # Update with your own count
  fit_eval_only: 0  # Update with your own count

  observations:
    note: >
      These are patterns from a small sample (13 evals). They should inform
      but not constrain the search. The sample skewed toward a narrow set of
      titles (Solutions Engineer, Data Engineer, Solutions Architect) and may
      not reflect fit for the many other roles mapped in the skill clusters above.

    what_scored_well:
      - "Roles that valued breadth over deep single-tool specialization"
      - "JDs that mentioned 'build from scratch', 'first hire', or 'greenfield'"
      - "Companies with 50-500 employees (all 7.5+ scores were in this range)"
      - "Roles combining technical work with client/stakeholder interaction"

    what_scored_poorly:
      - "Roles requiring deep vendor-specific certification (Databricks, Snowflake admin)"
      - "Staff/Principal level at large companies (expect 8+ years of narrow specialization)"
      - "Niche domains with no transferable overlap (blockchain, DevSecOps)"

    untested_categories:
      - "Revenue Operations Engineer — strong skill overlap, zero applications so far"
      - "DataOps Engineer — pipeline + CI/CD + quality, zero applications"
      - "BI Engineer / BI Developer — 150+ dashboards, BI migration, zero applications"
      - "Technical Program Manager — cross-functional delivery, zero applications"
      - "Developer Advocate — documentation expert + client-facing, zero applications"
      - "Technical Account Manager — NRR/GRR metrics + complex accounts, zero applications"
      - "Data Quality Engineer — strongest differentiator, zero applications"
      - "Customer Success Engineer — onboarding + retention, zero applications"
      - "Business Systems Engineer — CRM + data + internal tools, zero applications"

    recommendation: >
      Actively seek out roles in untested categories to expand the signal.
      A single high-scoring fit eval in a new category is more strategically
      valuable than a fifth Solutions Engineer application.

## OVERALL FIT SCORE

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills Fit | 9/10 | dbt expert + analytics engineering + BI tooling = precisely what this role needs |
| Domain Experience Fit | 8/10 | Data tools / developer tooling is a natural domain for someone who's lived the analytics engineering problems this product solves |
| Soft Skills & Culture Fit | 8/10 | Technical communication, teaching, open-source culture (Lightdash values) align strongly |
| Seniority Fit | 7/10 | Content creation and DevRel community work is new territory, which reduces the seniority score slightly |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **7.5/10** | The strongest match for the dbt expertise specifically. The advocate/DevRel angle is a different track but a natural extension. |
| Recency Modifier | 0 | Unknown |
| Competition Modifier | 0 | Unknown |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **7.5/10** | |
| Interview Success Probability | ~45-50% | Would clear the technical bar easily; content creation and community presence gap may be the deciding factor |

---

## GAP ANALYSIS

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Public content creation (blog posts, video tutorials) | MODERATE | Frame: "I've created extensive internal documentation, runbooks, and best practices guides. I'm ready to bring that same rigor to public content. I have specific opinions on dbt testing patterns and data quality workflows that I haven't had a public venue to share yet." |
| Community/conference representation | MINOR | Frame: "I've taught analytics engineering practices internally and led team onboarding sessions. Moving that to the community level is a natural next step I'm actively interested in." |
| Open-source contributions | MINOR | If time permits before applying, create one small dbt-related GitHub contribution or tutorial project. Even a dbt test package or macro repo signals intent. |

## POSITIONING STRATEGY

**Lead Narrative:** "Analytics engineer with 7 years and 1,900+ production dbt models who has spent the last 3 years teaching the tools I use to teammates, building best practices documentation, and advocating for data quality standards. Lightdash is built for people like me, and I want to help other analytics engineers get there."

**Strategic Note:** This role opens the DevRel/Enablement cluster identified in career-strategy.yaml — a path that could lead to technical advocacy roles at dbt Labs, Monte Carlo, Hightouch, and similar data tool companies.

---

## RECOMMENDATION: APPLY

This is the strongest match for James's dbt expertise specifically. No other role on the market is as directly aligned to 3 years of expert-level dbt production work. The content creation and community work are genuine gaps but learnable — Lightdash's culture ("build in public") is explicitly about learning in the open.

The comp ceiling ($150K) is lower than some other roles, but this role also opens a new career track (developer advocacy for data tools) that has strong long-term potential.

## COVER LETTER

To the Hiring Team at Lightdash,

I am writing to express my interest in the Analytics Engineering Advocate role at Lightdash. You're looking for someone who has lived the analytics engineering problems your product solves and can help other data teams get there. Three years and 1,900+ production dbt models later, I think that's me.

At Success Academy Charter Schools, I joined a data team with no formal analytics engineering practice and built it from scratch. Testing standards, automated monitoring, observability workflows, a Medallion-layered dbt environment, a Looker migration across 150+ dashboards. I also created the documentation: best practices sheets, PR review standards, runbooks, data lineage docs in dbt Docs and Confluence that DOE auditors and engineers used daily. When new engineers joined the team, I ran the technical onboarding and the "Rubber Duck" debugging sessions. Teaching the stack was a deliberate part of the job, and I was good at it.

At QuotaPath, I took that same approach to a different domain: ELT pipelines across 10+ CRM and financial platforms, dbt models aligned to Medallion architecture, validation frameworks that cut incidents by 50%+. I worked daily with Cursor, ChatGPT, and Claude, and I have strong opinions on where AI tools accelerate analytics engineering and where they introduce risk, particularly around test generation and data model documentation.

Lightdash is the product I would have wanted at both of those companies. The idea of helping other analytics engineers get more from their dbt projects, through pairing, tutorials, and community, is a natural extension of what I've already been doing internally. I haven't written public blog posts yet, but I have a backlog of opinions on dbt testing patterns, data quality frameworks, and when not to add a dbt model that I'd be genuinely excited to put into the world.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience building analytics engineering practices from scratch could add value to the Lightdash community.

Best regards,

James Mayo

## Job Summary
Staff Solutions Architect role at LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain interoperability protocol. Requires blockchain/Web3 fundamentals, smart contracts, Solidity/Rust/Go/TypeScript, DeFi, cross-chain architecture, and L1/L2/rollups knowledge. Location: NYC.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 2/10 | APIs, documentation; no Solidity, Rust, Go, blockchain |
| Domain Experience | 1/10 | No Web3, DeFi, cross-chain, or crypto experience |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 5/10 | Customer-facing, technical communication; domain mismatch overshadows |
| Seniority | 4/10 | Staff-level; experience is in unrelated domain |
| **Overall** | **2/10** | Fundamental domain mismatch; no transferable blockchain skills |

## Key Gaps
- Blockchain/Web3 fundamentals — **critical** (entire role is Web3-native)
- Smart contracts, Solidity — **critical** (core technical requirement)
- Rust/Go/TypeScript for blockchain — **critical** (primary languages)
- DeFi, cross-chain architecture, L1/L2/rollups — **critical** (domain-specific)
- LayerZero or similar protocol knowledge — **critical** (employer-specific)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Production experience with smart contracts (Solidity) or Rust in blockchain context
- DeFi protocol or cross-chain integration work
- Demonstrated understanding of L1/L2 architectures and rollups
- This role is not viable without Web3 background; would require career pivot and 1-2 years of focused blockchain experience

## Overall Fit Score

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical Skills Fit** | **8/10** | Strong match on core data engineering stack: Python, SQL, dbt, Snowflake/Redshift, AWS, data modeling, data quality, ETL/ELT. The modern data stack alignment is excellent. Airflow gap is minor (has adjacent orchestration experience). |
| **Domain Experience Fit** | **3/10** | Zero healthcare data experience. No FHIR, HL7, EHR APIs, or clinical/claims data. This is listed as a requirement, not preferred. However, the transferability of messy client data integration experience is significant — James has onboarded 300+ clients with diverse, non-standardized data formats. |
| **Soft Skills & Culture Fit** | **9/10** | Excellent cross-functional collaboration, clear communication with technical and non-technical stakeholders. Early-stage startup experience at QuotaPath and Cision/Trendkite. Comfort with broad scope and ambiguity. Eagle Scout leadership. |
| **Seniority Fit** | **8/10** | 7+ years experience exceeds 4-6+ requirement. 2 direct reports, architecture decisions, process creation from scratch. Solid mid-senior fit. |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **7.5/10** | The data engineering fundamentals are a strong match — data modeling, dbt, data quality, Python, SQL, AWS, client integrations. The healthcare data gap is the single biggest risk factor. It is listed as a requirement, but the early-stage nature of the company and the breadth of the role suggest they may value strong data engineering fundamentals over domain-specific healthcare experience. |
| **Recency Modifier** | **-0.25** | ~4 weeks old — applicant pool is established, may be in screening |
| **Competition Modifier** | **0** | Estimated 25-75 applicants — moderate, but healthcare requirement narrows the competitive pool |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **7.25/10** | Drops below 7.5 threshold when competition-adjusted. Healthcare gap + aging post reduces urgency. Still worth applying if interested in the $200-250k comp and AI/healthcare intersection. |
| **Interview Success Probability** | **30-45%** | Phone screen likely passable on data engineering fundamentals alone. Technical screen may probe healthcare data standards (FHIR/HL7) where James has zero experience. If the team weighs healthcare experience heavily, this could be a quick rejection. If they prioritize data engineering depth and see healthcare as learnable, strong chance of advancing. |

---

## Gap Analysis

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Healthcare data (FHIR/HL7, EHR APIs, clinical/claims data)** | **CRITICAL** | Zero experience. This is listed as a requirement, not preferred. Mitigation: (1) Frame 300+ client integration experience as directly transferable — James has handled messy, non-standardized data from dozens of different source systems. (2) Address proactively in cover letter as area of active learning. (3) Study FHIR/HL7 basics before interview (FHIR is a REST-based API standard, which aligns with James's REST API experience). (4) Emphasize data quality and observability skills as the mechanism for handling messy clinical/claims data. |
| **Airflow production orchestration** | **MODERATE** | Foundational Airflow exposure only. Has CircleCI/Prefect orchestration and Step Functions experience. Mitigation: (1) Highlight existing orchestration experience with adjacent tools. (2) Airflow is a widely documented tool with a manageable learning curve for someone with orchestration concepts. (3) dbt + Airflow is a common pairing James could ramp into quickly given dbt expertise. |
| **GCP depth** | **MINOR** | BigQuery/Google Cloud CLI at QuotaPath (1yr). JD lists AWS/GCP as alternatives. AWS experience is strong. Mitigation: Not needed — AWS experience is sufficient since JD lists both. |

## Positioning Strategy

**Lead Narrative:**
"Data engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable data infrastructure, with deep expertise in data modeling (1,900+ dbt models), data quality automation, and client data integrations across diverse source systems — seeking to apply these foundations to healthcare data at Trovo Health."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. **Success Academy** — 1,900+ dbt models, Medallion architecture, 90+ ETL pipelines, data quality from scratch, AWS, TB-scale data. This role most directly maps to Trovo's data modeling and infrastructure needs.
2. **QuotaPath** — 300+ client integrations, data validation frameworks, Python/Dask transforms, Snowflake, CI/CD. Maps to client integrations and data quality responsibilities.
3. **Cision** — Production data quality, GDPR compliance, data governance. Shows data integrity and compliance instincts relevant to regulated healthcare data.

**Skills to Highlight:**
1. Data modeling (1,900+ dbt models, Medallion architecture)
2. Data quality and observability (built from scratch, 50%+ incident reduction)
3. Python and SQL (production-grade, TB-scale)
4. dbt (expert, 3+ years)
5. Client integrations and ETL workflows (300+ at QuotaPath, 90+ at SA)
6. AWS (Lambda, Redshift, RDS)
7. Snowflake and Redshift
8. Cross-functional collaboration and clear communication

**Skills to De-emphasize:**
- CRM-specific details (Salesforce/HubSpot — mention as source systems, not as a specialty)
- Zapier / low-code tools (not relevant to data engineering)
- BI tooling details (Looker/Sisense — mention migration as evidence of system thinking)
- AI-assisted development (interesting but not relevant to JD)
- ECP and earlier roles (not relevant)

**Reframing Suggestions:**
- "Engineered and delivered tailored solutions for 300+ client onboarding projects" → "Designed and built data ingestion pipelines for 300+ client integrations across diverse source systems, handling non-standardized data formats at scale"
- "Created SQL-based data validation frameworks" → "Built data quality and observability frameworks including automated monitoring, testing, and alerting"
- "Built and maintained 1,900+ dbt models" → "Architected and maintained 1,900+ dbt models across dimensional, staging, and mart layers supporting enterprise analytics"
- "Participated in Step Functions-based orchestration workflows" → "Supported pipeline orchestration using AWS Step Functions and CircleCI/Prefect"

---

## Red Flags

### JD Red Flags
- **Healthcare data listed as requirement, not preferred** — If they strictly screen for FHIR/HL7 experience, James may not pass initial review regardless of data engineering depth.
- **"Early-stage startup"** — Data foundations may not exist yet. This could be a positive (green-field opportunity) or a negative (ambiguity, shifting priorities, lack of structure).
- **Broad scope** — "Owning critical client integrations" + "build core data infrastructure" + "data quality" + "data modeling" is a lot for one person. May signal understaffing or unrealistic expectations.

### Candidate Red Flags
- **Zero healthcare data experience** — This is the dominant risk. If the interviewer asks "tell me about a time you worked with FHIR/HL7 data," James has no answer.
- **Airflow gap** — If Trovo uses Airflow heavily, the lack of production Airflow experience could surface in technical discussions.
- **Snowflake depth** — Intermediate proficiency (1yr, no admin/RBAC/cost optimization). If the role requires Snowflake administration, this could be a gap.

---

## Application Recommendation

**Recommendation: APPLY WITH CAVEATS**

**Reasoning:**
The core data engineering match is strong — data modeling, dbt, data quality, Python, SQL, AWS, client integrations all align well. The salary range ($200-250k + equity) is excellent. The early-stage startup context maps to James's experience at QuotaPath and Cision/Trendkite. The single major risk is the healthcare data requirement (FHIR/HL7, EHR APIs, clinical/claims data), which is listed as a hard requirement and where James has zero experience. However, the transferability argument is solid: James has integrated data from 300+ clients across dozens of source systems, built data quality frameworks for messy data at scale, and has strong REST API experience (FHIR is REST-based). The early-stage nature of the company may mean they value strong data engineering fundamentals over healthcare-specific experience.

**If Applying:**
- Lead cover letter with data infrastructure and data quality expertise
- Address healthcare data gap proactively — frame client integration experience as transferable to healthcare data integration
- Emphasize data quality and observability (monitoring, testing) — this is the #1 responsibility listed
- Highlight dbt expertise prominently (listed as preferred, and James is expert-level)
- Research FHIR/HL7 basics before any interview — FHIR is a REST API, which aligns with existing skills
- Mention early-stage startup experience and comfort with broad scope

# PART 3: COVER LETTER

Dear Hiring Manager,

The Data Engineer role at Trovo Health immediately caught my attention — building the data foundations that power AI-driven clinical care is exactly the kind of high-impact, foundational work I've spent my career doing in other domains, and I'd be excited to bring that experience to healthcare. With 7+ years of data engineering experience, deep expertise in data modeling and data quality, and a track record of building data infrastructure from the ground up at early-stage companies, I believe I can contribute meaningfully to Trovo's mission.

My strongest alignment with this role is in data modeling and data quality. At Success Academy Charter Schools, I architected Medallion-style warehousing layers in dbt Cloud, building and maintaining 1,900+ production models with comprehensive testing and documentation across enterprise domains. I created the entire data quality process from scratch — freshness, validity, and schema tests across 90+ ETL pipelines and TB-scale data. At QuotaPath, I designed data ingestion pipelines for 300+ client integrations, each pulling from different source systems with non-standardized data formats, and built automated validation frameworks that reduced data incidents by over 50%. I also migrated legacy SQL-based pipelines to Python (Dask/Pandas) transformations, cutting runtimes from hours to minutes. This combination of data modeling depth, data quality rigor, and client integration experience at scale is directly relevant to Trovo's needs around building reliable data infrastructure and owning client data integrations.

I want to be upfront: my data integration experience has been in SaaS and education, not healthcare. I haven't worked with FHIR, HL7, or EHR APIs. That said, the core challenge — ingesting messy, non-standardized data from diverse external systems, transforming it into clean models, and building observability to catch issues before they propagate — is one I've solved hundreds of times. FHIR is a REST-based standard, and I have strong REST API experience. I'm confident I can ramp into healthcare data standards quickly, and I'm genuinely motivated to do so.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my data engineering experience could help build the data foundations Trovo needs. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
James Mayo

## Overall Fit Score

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical Skills Fit** | **8/10** | SQL expert, strong cloud DW coverage (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift — missing only Databricks), dbt expert (exactly what partners use), Airbyte (Fivetran analogue), Salesforce integration, REST APIs. Gaps only in MarTech-specific tools (Braze, Iterable) and Databricks specifically. |
| **Domain Experience Fit** | **6/10** | Strong data infrastructure experience but no MarTech/AdTech domain exposure. Knows the data warehouse side of the composable CDP equation deeply, but not the activation/marketing side (Braze, Iterable, Salesforce Data Cloud as CDP). |
| **Soft Skills & Culture Fit** | **9/10** | High-agency, startup-tested, cross-functional by default, strong documentation practices, technical advisory experience, architecture-level thinking. Matches Hightouch's "high-leverage, high-agency" culture signal well. |
| **Seniority Fit** | **8/10** | 7+ years of experience, rapid promotions, 2 direct reports, architecture decisions, process creation from scratch. Exceeds the 4+ year minimum. |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **8/10** | The modern data stack technical foundation is exceptionally strong — SQL, dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery, Airbyte, Salesforce integration. The SE experience at QuotaPath directly maps to the role's day-to-day. Main gaps are partner-channel-specific GTM (pivotable from direct customer GTM) and MarTech domain (learnable). |
| **Recency Modifier** | **+0.25** | 6 days old — still within first week, good timing |
| **Competition Modifier** | **-0.5** | 200+ applicants confirmed — very high competition |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **7.75/10** | Still above threshold, but high applicant volume means the resume needs to stand out. dbt expertise and modern data stack fluency are genuine differentiators in this pool. |
| **Interview Success Probability** | **50-65%** | Strong chance of passing initial screen — modern data stack expertise and SE background are compelling and differentiated. Technical discussions around SQL, dbt, and warehouse architecture will be strong. Partner GTM and MarTech domain questions are the risk areas. Hightouch's composable CDP positioning aligns well with James's data-infrastructure-to-business-value experience. |

---

## Gap Analysis

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Partner-specific GTM (channel/ecosystem) experience** | **MODERATE** | No direct partner-channel work. Mitigate: frame QuotaPath SE work (scoping with AEs, cross-functional GTM alignment, 300+ projects) as directly transferable partner motions. Supervised 5+ vendor workflows at Cision shows third-party coordination. Address in cover letter as a motivated pivot. Study Hightouch's partner ecosystem (Snowflake Partner Connect, Databricks Partner Program, etc.) before interview. |
| **MarTech/AdTech domain (Braze, Iterable, marketing automation)** | **MODERATE** | No Braze, Iterable, or marketing automation platform experience. Mitigate: deep Salesforce integration experience is adjacent. Frame knowledge of data activation (warehouse → business systems) from the data engineering side. Research Braze/Iterable integration patterns pre-interview. The role emphasizes warehouse-side knowledge (SQL, dbt, Snowflake) more than marketing tool expertise. |
| **Databricks hands-on experience** | **MINOR** | No Databricks specifically, but has Snowflake and BigQuery. All three are cloud data warehouses — the SQL and modeling skills transfer directly. Databricks-specific concepts (Unity Catalog, Delta Lake) can be studied. |
| **Fivetran (has Airbyte instead)** | **MINOR** | Airbyte and Fivetran serve the same function (ELT ingestion). Direct experience with Airbyte at QuotaPath. Fivetran's UI and connector model are similar — minimal ramp time. |
| **25% travel requirement** | **MINOR** | May require lifestyle adjustment. Address proactively if asked — express willingness. |

## Positioning Strategy

**Lead Narrative:**
"Solutions Engineer with 7+ years building on the modern data stack — SQL, dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery, Airbyte — with a proven track record delivering 300+ enterprise data solutions and translating complex warehouse architectures into business value for technical and executive audiences."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. **QuotaPath** — Solutions engineering, modern data stack (Snowflake, dbt, BigQuery, Airbyte), 300+ client solutions, scoping with sales, cross-functional GTM alignment, architecture reviews
2. **Success Academy** — dbt expertise (1,900+ models), Salesforce/dbt API integration, cross-functional delivery, system migrations, data quality at enterprise scale
3. **Cision/Trendkite (Enterprise Account Architect)** — Enterprise client-facing technical advisory, startup experience, navigated acquisition

**Skills to Highlight:**
1. SQL (expert, 7yr)
2. dbt Cloud (expert, 1,900+ models, 3yr)
3. Snowflake (hands-on, QuotaPath)
4. BigQuery / Google Cloud (hands-on, QuotaPath)
5. Airbyte / data integration (Fivetran analogue)
6. Salesforce integration (4yr, deep)
7. REST APIs (3yr)
8. Solutions engineering / technical advisory
9. Cross-functional GTM coordination (Product, Engineering, Sales, CS)

**Skills to De-emphasize:**
- AWS Lambda/Step Functions (too infrastructure-specific)
- Jenkins (legacy tooling)
- Zendesk (support tool)
- BI tooling details (Looker/Sisense — mention migration only)
- Big Data exposure (Hadoop, streaming — not relevant)
- Cassandra, ElasticSearch (Cision-specific)

**Reframing Suggestions:**
- "Designed scalable ELT pipelines integrating CRM and financial system data into Snowflake" → "Architected data integration solutions on Snowflake using dbt and modern ELT patterns, enabling enterprise clients to activate CRM and financial data"
- "Scoped with prospects and account executives to qualify customer data integration requirements" → "Partnered with sales to translate complex customer data challenges into actionable technical guidance and solution architectures"

## Red Flags

### JD Red Flags
- **"Operate more like a GTM strategist and operator than traditional SE"** — This is a hybrid GTM/SE role. May involve more business development, pipeline tracking, and partner management than pure technical work. Clarify the technical-to-GTM ratio in the interview.
- **"Work across dozens of deals at once through partner influence"** — High context-switching. Success depends on partner relationships, not just technical quality. Could be frustrating if partner engagement is low.
- **"25% travel"** — Non-trivial travel commitment for partner events and enablement. Confirm expectations and flexibility.
- **Wide salary band ($130-230k OTE)** — Large range suggests flexibility but also potential for landing on the lower end without negotiation leverage.

### Candidate Red Flags
- **No partner GTM experience** — Interviewers may probe whether James understands the difference between direct customer SE work and partner-channel motions (influence vs. direct delivery, enablement at scale vs. 1:1 solutioning).
- **No MarTech/AdTech domain** — If the role requires deep familiarity with Braze, Iterable, or marketing automation workflows, the gap could be more significant than it appears.
- **"Data Engineer" positioning vs. "Solutions Engineer"** — James's most recent resume positioning leans data engineering / platform architecture. Need to reframe toward SE / technical advisory / GTM to avoid being bucketed as a data engineer looking for an SE role.
- **Recent role duration** — QuotaPath was ~1 year. Interviewers may question tenure stability, though this is common in startup environments.

---

## Application Recommendation

**Recommendation: APPLY**

**Reasoning:**
This is a strong fit. The role's core technical requirements — SQL, cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery), dbt, modern data stack, enterprise SaaS integration — map directly to James's deepest expertise. The SE experience at QuotaPath (300+ projects, scoping with sales, architecture reviews, cross-functional delivery) provides a compelling narrative for the partner SE function. The gaps (partner-channel GTM, MarTech domain) are real but moderate — the role emphasizes data infrastructure knowledge more than marketing tool expertise, and partner GTM motions are a learnable pivot from direct customer GTM. Hightouch's culture (high-agency, startup, remote) aligns well with James's work history.

**If Applying:**
- Lead with modern data stack expertise: dbt (1,900+ models), Snowflake, BigQuery, Airbyte — this is Hightouch's language
- Emphasize the QuotaPath SE experience: 300+ projects, scoping with sales, technical advisory
- Frame customer-facing GTM experience as directly transferable to partner motions
- Research Hightouch's partner ecosystem (Snowflake Partner Connect, Databricks Marketplace, GCP integrations) and reference specific partner plays
- Address MarTech gap proactively — deep Salesforce integration is adjacent, and the role emphasizes warehouse-side expertise
- Prepare to discuss composable CDP architecture and reverse ETL concepts in interview
- Study Braze/Iterable basics to demonstrate curiosity and ramp willingness

# PART 3: COVER LETTER

Dear Hiring Manager,

When I saw the Partner Solutions Engineer role at Hightouch, it immediately resonated. I've spent the last several years living in the exact ecosystem Hightouch activates — designing ELT pipelines on Snowflake, building dbt models aligned to Medallion architecture, integrating data from Salesforce, HubSpot, and a dozen other platforms, and translating complex data warehouse architectures into business value for enterprise clients. The opportunity to help Hightouch's partners and their customers unlock the full potential of their warehouse-native data is a natural extension of the work I've been doing.

At QuotaPath, I served as a Solutions Engineer delivering 300+ technical solutions annually across 10+ enterprise platforms, partnering with sales to scope data integration requirements during the deal cycle, leading architecture reviews with Product and Engineering, and designing composable dbt-and-Snowflake-based pipelines that scaled from lightweight configurations to enterprise-grade implementations. Before that, at Success Academy Charter Schools, I scaled a dbt Cloud environment to 1,900+ production models, utilized Salesforce and dbt APIs to maintain 90+ ETL pipelines, and led multi-phase system migrations — all while coordinating cross-functionally with Engineering, Analytics, and Operations. I've worked hands-on with Snowflake, BigQuery, Airbyte, and the broader modern data stack — the same tools Hightouch's partners build with every day.

I'll be transparent: my GTM experience has been direct customer-facing rather than partner-channel-specific. But the core competencies transfer directly — technical discovery, solution architecture, enablement material creation, demo delivery, and cross-functional coordination across Sales, Product, and Engineering. I've navigated a startup acquisition at Cision/Trendkite, been promoted three times in under two years, and consistently served as the technical bridge between business needs and data architecture. I'm excited about applying that same approach at the partner ecosystem level.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my modern data stack expertise and solutions engineering background can help Hightouch scale partner-sourced revenue.

Best regards,
James Mayo

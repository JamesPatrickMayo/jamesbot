## Job Summary
Professional Services SaaS implementation role focused on enterprise customer onboarding and configuration. Requires 5-8 years of enterprise SaaS implementation experience, with strong emphasis on SSO/SAML/OAuth troubleshooting and web services/APIs. Nice-to-haves include ETL, CRM (Salesforce), AWS, and JavaScript. Compensation: $105-120k, Remote US.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 5/10 | Strong on APIs, Salesforce, documentation; weak on SSO/SAML/OAuth specifically |
| Domain Experience | 6/10 | 300+ client onboarding at QuotaPath, SaaS experience; not professional services consulting |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 7/10 | Strong client/stakeholder management, technical communication |
| Seniority | 6/10 | 7+ years experience fits range; lacks Gainsight platform and enterprise implementation consulting |
| **Overall** | **5.5/10** | Solid customer-facing and SaaS background, but core identity/access requirements and consulting model are gaps |

## Key Gaps
- SSO/SAML/OAuth troubleshooting expertise — **high severity** (core requirement, not in candidate's skill set)
- Professional services / consulting background — **high severity** (role is implementation consulting, not internal engineering)
- Gainsight platform familiarity — **medium severity** (can be learned, but not a differentiator)
- Salary band ($105-120k) — **medium severity** (likely below candidate's expectations given prior roles)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Demonstrated SSO/SAML/OAuth implementation and troubleshooting experience across multiple identity providers
- Prior role in professional services, implementation consulting, or customer success engineering at an enterprise SaaS vendor
- Willingness to accept lower compensation band for role alignment

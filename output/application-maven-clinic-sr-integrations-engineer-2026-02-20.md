## Overall Fit Score

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical Skills Fit** | **7/10** | Strong on APIs, Python, ETL/integration design, automation, testing. Gaps in OAuth/SAML/SCIM, TypeScript, Okta/IAM, and Workato specifically. But the integration methodology is directly transferable. |
| **Domain Experience Fit** | **6/10** | No healthcare domain, but extensive SaaS experience. The role is IT/enterprise technology, not healthcare-specific, so domain matters less here. |
| **Soft Skills & Culture Fit** | **9/10** | Excellent cross-functional collaboration, documentation, communication. High-growth SaaS experience. Eagle Scout. Volunteer work. Strong culture match for a mission-driven company. |
| **Seniority Fit** | **8/10** | 7+ years experience, 2 direct reports, architecture decisions, process creation. Solid mid-senior fit. |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **7.5/10** | The integration engineering core is strong. The gaps (Okta, TypeScript, OAuth/SAML specifically) are learnable and not dealbreakers for a candidate with this much integration experience. |
| **Interview Success Probability** | **40-55%** | Good chance of passing initial screen — integration experience and SaaS background are compelling. Technical screen may probe OAuth/SAML/SCIM and TypeScript where James is weakest. Strong performance on system design and architecture discussions. |

---

## Gap Analysis

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity & Access Management (Okta, SCIM)** | **MODERATE** | No IAM experience. Can mitigate: frame Salesforce API integration (which uses OAuth flows) as adjacent. Study Okta/SCIM basics before interview. Address in cover letter as "eager to expand into." |
| **OAuth / SAML / SCIM protocols specifically** | **MODERATE** | Has worked with APIs that use OAuth (Salesforce) but hasn't built auth flows. Can learn quickly — these are protocol-level concepts, not years of domain knowledge. |
| **TypeScript / JavaScript** | **MODERATE** | Python-only. TypeScript is listed alongside Python as acceptable. Lead with Python strength and express willingness to pick up TS. |
| **Workato platform** | **MINOR** | Has Zapier (same category). Workato is a no-code/low-code platform — ramp time is weeks, not months. |
| **ADP / HRIS tools** | **MINOR** | Listed alongside Salesforce. Strong Salesforce experience covers the CRM side. ADP specifically is learnable. |

## Positioning Strategy

**Lead Narrative:**
"Integration engineer with 7+ years of experience building and maintaining 300+ enterprise system integrations across CRM, financial, and SaaS platforms, with deep expertise in automated data validation and cross-functional technical delivery."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. **QuotaPath** — 300+ integration projects, 10+ platforms, Zapier, REST APIs, Python automation, data validation
2. **Success Academy** — 90+ ETL pipelines, Salesforce API, automated testing at scale, system migrations, 2 direct reports
3. **Cision** — Production debugging (300+ issues), Jira/Slack integrations, GDPR compliance, Jenkins automation

**Skills to Highlight:**
1. Enterprise system integrations (REST APIs, CRM, financial platforms)
2. Python (production automation, data transformations)
3. Salesforce integration experience
4. Automation workflow design (Zapier, CI/CD, automated testing)
5. Documentation and runbooks
6. Debugging and root cause analysis in production
7. Cross-functional collaboration
8. Data validation and quality frameworks

**Skills to De-emphasize:**
- dbt Cloud, Medallion Architecture (too data-engineering-specific)
- Snowflake, Redshift (data warehouse details)
- BI tooling (Looker/Sisense)
- Big Data exposure (Hadoop, etc.)

**Reframing Suggestions:**
- "Designed scalable ELT pipelines integrating CRM and financial system data" → "Designed and maintained scalable integrations across 10+ enterprise SaaS platforms including Salesforce, HubSpot, and financial systems"
- "Created SQL-based data validation frameworks" → "Built automated monitoring and validation frameworks ensuring data reliability across enterprise integrations"
- "Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions" → "Designed fault-tolerant automation workflows with CI/CD pipelines achieving 70-90% deployment automation"
- "Documented lineage for 90+ ETL pipelines" → "Created and maintained detailed integration documentation including data flow diagrams, runbooks, and error-handling frameworks for 90+ data pipelines"

---

## Red Flags

### JD Red Flags
- **"Enterprise Technology" team, not Engineering** — This sits in IT, not product engineering. May have less autonomy and more ticket-driven work than expected.
- **Contract listed as employment type on LinkedIn** — The role may be contract, not full-time, despite the benefits listing. Clarify in interview.
- **"Level 2 support for users"** — Some portion of the role is IT support, not just integration engineering. Could be 10% or 40% — worth asking.

### Candidate Red Flags
- **No TypeScript** — If the team's primary language is TypeScript, this could be a harder gap than it appears.
- **No Okta/IAM specifics** — If a large part of the role is identity provisioning workflows (SCIM, Okta lifecycle), the gap could be significant.
- **"Integration Engineer" vs "Data Engineer"** — Interviewer may question whether James is looking for a data engineering role vs. truly interested in enterprise integration/IT.

---

## Application Recommendation

**Recommendation: APPLY**

**Reasoning:**
The core of this role — building enterprise integrations, automating workflows, working with APIs, maintaining documentation, troubleshooting production issues — maps directly to James's experience at QuotaPath and Success Academy. The gaps (Okta, OAuth/SAML, TypeScript) are real but learnable, and none are dealbreakers given the depth of integration experience. Maven Clinic is a strong culture match (mission-driven, high-growth SaaS, NYC hybrid). The salary range ($140-170k) is reasonable.

**If Applying:**
- Lead cover letter with 300+ integration projects and the breadth of platforms
- Specifically mention Salesforce integration (Maven uses it)
- Address the Okta/IAM gap proactively — frame it as an area you're actively developing
- Emphasize automated testing/validation — Maven explicitly wants "debugging, testing, and observability"
- Research Maven Clinic's product and mention interest in healthcare mission
- Clarify contract vs full-time status before investing too much time

# PART 3: COVER LETTER

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited about the Senior Integrations Engineer role at Maven Clinic. Building the connective tissue between enterprise systems — making sure data flows reliably, processes run automatically, and teams can trust the tools they depend on — is exactly what I've been doing for the past seven years, and doing it for a company that's genuinely improving healthcare access makes this especially compelling.

At QuotaPath, I designed and maintained integrations across 10+ enterprise SaaS platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Stripe, and more), delivering 300+ client integration projects annually. For each engagement, I evaluated the right integration approach — from lightweight Zapier automations to custom Python pipelines — then built automated validation frameworks to catch failures before they impacted production. I reduced data incidents by over 50% and automated 70-90% of our deployment pipeline through CI/CD workflows. Before that, at Success Academy Charter Schools, I managed integrations across 90+ ETL pipelines using Salesforce and dbt APIs, built automated monitoring for 150+ dashboards serving 18,000+ users, and led multi-phase system migrations that required meticulous documentation and error-handling design.

I'll be straightforward: my integration experience has been data-pipeline-centric rather than identity-platform-centric, so Okta and SCIM provisioning workflows are areas I'd be ramping into rather than arriving with deep expertise. That said, I've worked extensively with Salesforce's OAuth-based APIs, built fault-tolerant automation workflows with monitoring and alerting, and have a strong track record of picking up new platforms quickly — I was promoted three times in under two years at Cision as I expanded into progressively more technical roles.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my integration engineering experience could contribute to Maven's enterprise technology team.

Best regards,
James Mayo

<!-- GENERATION NOTES

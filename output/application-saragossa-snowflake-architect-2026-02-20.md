## Job Summary
Snowflake Architect role for a $70B+ AUM asset management firm. Requires deep Snowflake expertise, SQL, Python, E-Front integration, and financial services/investment data domain knowledge. Compensation: $150-280k, NYC.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 5/10 | SQL expert, Python advanced; Snowflake intermediate (1yr via dbt, not admin) |
| Domain Experience | 3/10 | No E-Front, no financial services/investment data, no distributed data center |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 6/10 | Client-facing, stakeholder management; role may be internal |
| Seniority | 5/10 | 7+ years fits; architect title implies platform ownership |
| **Overall** | **4.5/10** | Strong SQL/Python but domain and Snowflake depth are gaps |

## Key Gaps
- Deep Snowflake admin (warehouse sizing, RBAC, cost optimization, resource monitors) — **high severity** (candidate used Snowflake via dbt, didn't manage platform)
- E-Front integration — **high severity** (investment management platform, no experience)
- Financial services / investment data domain — **high severity** (asset management context)
- Distributed data center experience — **medium severity** (mentioned for enterprise clients)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Hands-on Snowflake platform administration: warehouse management, RBAC, cloning, cost optimization
- E-Front or similar investment management system integration experience
- Financial services or asset management data domain background

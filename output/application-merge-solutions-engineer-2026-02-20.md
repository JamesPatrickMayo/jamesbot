## Experience Relevance

| Role | Relevance | Reasoning | Best Bullets |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Solutions Engineer @ QuotaPath** | **HIGH** | This IS the target role. James was literally a Solutions Engineer building integrations for a B2B SaaS company across 10+ platforms, delivering 300+ client projects annually, building POCs, scoping with prospects, and collaborating cross-functionally with engineering and product. The day-to-day is nearly identical to what Merge describes. | 300+ client integration projects; 10+ SaaS platform integrations; scoping with prospects/AEs during sales cycle; architecture reviews; data validation frameworks; mentoring junior engineers; engineering documentation |
| **Enterprise Account Architect @ Cision/Trendkite** | **HIGH** | Client-facing technical role at a startup. Built dashboards and reports per client requirements. Translated "client speak" into technical implementation. Managed multi-timezone handoffs. Navigated startup acquisition. Shows the sales-adjacent technical skillset Merge wants. | Client requirements translation; dashboard/report construction; knowledge management; startup acquisition navigation |
| **Data Quality Analyst / Analytics Engineer @ Success Academy** | **MEDIUM** | Demonstrates technical depth, cross-functional delivery, and leadership (2 direct reports). System migration experience shows ability to manage complex technical transitions. Less relevant because it's not client-facing or sales-adjacent. | 90+ ETL pipelines; cross-functional delivery; system migrations; managed 2 direct reports; documentation in Confluence/dbt Docs |
| **Production Engineer / DQA @ Cision** | **MEDIUM** | Root cause analysis (300+ bugs), vendor workflow supervision, GDPR compliance. Shows debugging skills and ability to manage technical escalations — relevant to supporting prospects through integration challenges. | 300+ bug investigations; vendor workflow supervision; Jira/Slack integrations for triage; onboarding new hires |
| **Repair/Support Tech @ ECP Computers** | **LOW-MEDIUM** | 5-year client-facing technical role. Demonstrates customer empathy, technical problem-solving, and communication with non-technical audiences. Relevant to the solutions engineering soft skills even though the domain is different. | Technical solutions for 25+ businesses; team leadership (4 technicians); client presentations |

---

## Overall Fit Score

| Category | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical Skills Fit** | **8/10** | The JD is intentionally light on specific technical requirements — it's looking for someone who understands API architectures, integration patterns, and can build POCs. James has deep integration experience across 10+ platforms, REST API proficiency, Python and SQL expertise, and CI/CD automation. The Merge product (unified API) maps directly to the multi-platform integration work at QuotaPath. |
| **Domain Experience Fit** | **9/10** | Merge builds integrations for B2B SaaS companies. James spent 1+ year at QuotaPath doing exactly that — building integrations across CRM and financial SaaS platforms for B2B customers. The domain overlap is nearly 1:1. |
| **Soft Skills & Culture Fit** | **9/10** | Startup experience at both QuotaPath and Trendkite. Builder mentality (created QA process from scratch, established engineering documentation standards). Cross-functional collaboration across every role. Strong written and verbal communication. Eagle Scout. The "create the foundation for a rapidly growing team" aspect of the JD matches James's track record of building processes and standards from zero. |
| **Seniority Fit** | **8/10** | 7+ years of progressive technical experience. 1+ year with the exact title "Solutions Engineer." Mentored junior engineers, managed direct reports, led architecture reviews. Solidly meets the 3+ year requirement with significant headroom. |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **8.5/10** | This is one of the strongest matches in the pipeline. The role description reads like a summary of what James did at QuotaPath. The API integration domain, the solutions engineering function, the startup environment, the cross-functional collaboration, and the prospect-facing technical work all align directly. |
| **Recency Modifier** | **+0.25** | 1 week old on LinkedIn — fresh repost, still in early applicant window |
| **Competition Modifier** | **-0.25** | High-profile startup (LinkedIn Top Startup 2025), but 1-week LinkedIn age limits the pile |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **8.5/10** | Strongest application in the batch when accounting for fresh LinkedIn repost. |
| **Interview Success Probability** | **60-75%** | Strong chance of passing screens — the title match alone (Solutions Engineer to Solutions Engineer) eliminates the "career pivot" narrative. Technical discussions around API architecture, integration patterns, and POC delivery should be very comfortable. Main risk is if the interview probes deep product knowledge of Merge's specific API layer or tests live coding. |

---

## Gap Analysis

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **5 days/week in-office** | **MODERATE** | James is based in NYC, which is one of the two listed locations. The concern is preference, not logistics — James's recent role (QuotaPath) was remote. Frame as excited about the in-person collaboration and team-building aspect. |
| **Merge-specific product knowledge (unified API layer, AI agent handlers)** | **MINOR** | No candidate will have this. Study Merge's documentation, API reference, and use cases before interviewing. James's experience integrating across 10+ SaaS platforms gives strong context for understanding why a unified API matters. |
| **Live coding / demo ability** | **MINOR** | The role likely involves live demos and POC-building. James has workshop and onboarding experience but should prepare a polished demo workflow. Practice walking through API integration scenarios. |
| **No explicit "sales engineering" title** | **MINOR** | James held the "Solutions Engineer" title at QuotaPath, which is the exact title Merge is hiring for. The work included scoping with prospects and AEs during sales cycles, which is sales engineering in practice. |

---

## Positioning Strategy

**Lead Narrative:**
"Solutions Engineer with direct experience building API integrations across 10+ B2B SaaS platforms, delivering 300+ client integration projects including POCs, technical workshops, and cross-functional collaboration with engineering and product teams — in a startup environment."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. **QuotaPath** — Near-identical role: Solutions Engineer building integrations, scoping with prospects, collaborating with eng/product, 300+ client projects, startup environment
2. **Cision/Trendkite (Enterprise Account Architect)** — Startup experience, client-facing technical work, translating requirements into solutions
3. **Cision (Production Engineer)** — Debugging, triage, vendor management, technical escalation handling

**Skills to Highlight:**
1. Solutions engineering (title match, function match)
2. API integrations across 10+ SaaS platforms
3. POC delivery and technical workshops
4. Cross-functional collaboration with engineering and product
5. Startup experience (QuotaPath, Trendkite)
6. Technical communication and documentation
7. Python and SQL proficiency
8. Process building from scratch

**Skills to De-emphasize:**
- dbt Cloud, Medallion Architecture (too data-engineering-specific)
- Snowflake, Redshift (data warehouse internals)
- BI tooling (Looker/Sisense)
- AWS infrastructure details
- Data quality automation specifics

**Reframing Suggestions:**
- "Designed scalable ELT pipelines integrating CRM and financial system data" → "Architected and delivered API integrations across 10+ enterprise SaaS platforms for 300+ client engagements"
- "Scoped with prospects and account executives to qualify customer data integration requirements" → "Led technical discovery with prospects and account executives, scoping integration requirements and building proofs of concept during the sales cycle"
- "Led architecture reviews and design reviews" → "Led technical workshops and architecture reviews to ensure integration patterns met both immediate needs and long-term scalability"
- "Mentored junior engineers and led technical onboarding sessions" → "Built team knowledge and onboarding processes, contributing to the foundation of a growing solutions engineering function"

---

## Red Flags

### JD Red Flags
- **"Create the foundation for a rapidly growing solutions engineering team"** — This may mean James would be one of the first (or the first) Solutions Engineers. High impact but also high ambiguity, potential lack of structure, and possible scope creep.
- **5 days/week in-office** — Aggressive RTO policy. Could indicate a culture that prioritizes presence over output. Worth asking about flexibility.
- **Vague technical requirements** — The JD doesn't specify languages, tools, or tech stack. This could mean the role is more relationship/communication-focused than deeply technical, or it could mean they expect candidates to figure it out.

### Candidate Red Flags
- **Recent role was remote** — QuotaPath was fully remote. Interviewer may probe commitment to 5 days/week in-office. Have a clear answer prepared.
- **"Data Platform Architect" in title** — The dual title at QuotaPath might make interviewers question whether James is a data engineer applying for a solutions role vs. a true solutions engineer. Lead with the Solutions Engineer side of the title.
- **Short tenure at QuotaPath (13 months)** — While normal for startups, it may raise questions. Be ready to explain the circumstances (company direction, layoffs, etc.).

---

## Application Recommendation

**Recommendation: APPLY**

**Reasoning:**
This is an excellent match — arguably the strongest in the current pipeline. The role is a Solutions Engineer building API integrations for B2B SaaS at a high-growth startup. James was literally a Solutions Engineer building API integrations for B2B SaaS at a startup (QuotaPath). The function, title, domain, and environment all align. The salary range ($190-220k + equity) is strong. Merge is a well-funded, high-visibility company (LinkedIn Top Startup, Forbes recognition). The only meaningful consideration is the 5 days/week in-office requirement, which is a lifestyle preference rather than a qualification gap.

**If Applying:**
- Lead with the title match: Solutions Engineer → Solutions Engineer
- Emphasize the 300+ client integration projects across 10+ SaaS platforms — this directly mirrors Merge's unified API product
- Highlight POC building, technical workshops, and prospect-facing scoping work
- Mention startup experience at both QuotaPath and Trendkite
- Research Merge's product deeply — understand the Unified API and Agent Handler products
- Prepare to demo/walkthrough an API integration scenario
- Have a clear, enthusiastic answer for the in-office question

# PART 3: COVER LETTER

Dear Hiring Manager,

When I read that Merge is looking for a Solutions Engineer to lead technical engagements with prospects deploying API integrations, I recognized my last role almost exactly. As a Solutions Engineer at QuotaPath, I spent every day doing precisely this — building proofs of concept, leading technical workshops, and designing integration architectures across 10+ SaaS platforms for 300+ client engagements annually. The chance to do that work at the company building the unified API layer for B2B SaaS is a natural next step I'm genuinely excited about.

At QuotaPath, I owned the technical side of prospect and client engagements end-to-end. I scoped integration requirements with account executives during the sales cycle, built POCs tailored to each prospect's platform stack (Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Stripe, and others), and led architecture reviews to ensure our integration patterns scaled with growing client complexity. I built automated validation frameworks that reduced integration incidents by over 50%, developed Python-based transformation workflows that cut processing times from hours to minutes, and partnered directly with engineering and product to prioritize feature development based on what I was hearing from prospects. Before that, I navigated the Trendkite-to-Cision acquisition as an Enterprise Account Architect — translating client requirements into technical solutions and building support structures from scratch in a fast-moving startup environment.

What excites me most about Merge is the "create the foundation" aspect of this role. At both QuotaPath and Success Academy, I built processes from zero — onboarding frameworks, documentation standards, QA workflows, architecture review cadences. I understand what it takes to establish the systems and practices that let a solutions engineering function scale, and I'd bring that builder mentality to Merge's team.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my integration engineering and solutions experience could contribute to Merge's growth.

Best regards,
James Mayo

<!-- GENERATION NOTES

## Accomplishments Highlighted
1. 300+ client integration projects across 10+ platforms — direct mirror of Merge's product domain
2. POC building and technical workshops with prospects — exact JD function

## Gaps Addressed
- No critical gaps to address in cover letter. The role requirements are a strong match.
- In-office requirement not addressed (better handled in conversation than letter).

## Tone Notes
- More confident and direct than Maven letter — this is a stronger match, so less hedging
- Emphasized the "builder" narrative since JD specifically calls out creating team foundation
- Kept it conversational per structure guidance
- Did NOT fabricate any experience

## Alternative Angles Not Used
- Could mention Eagle Scout for leadership signal
- Could reference specific Merge products (Unified API, Agent Handler) — worth adding if applying via referral
- Could mention ECP Computers for additional client-facing evidence — excluded for brevity

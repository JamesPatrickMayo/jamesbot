## Job Summary
Solutions Architect role for Snowflake's East region. Requires 5+ years as data architect/engineer, 3+ years consulting experience, deep Snowflake platform expertise, and AI/ML workload familiarity. SQL and Python expected. Compensation: $136-178.5k, Massachusetts.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 5/10 | SQL/Python strong, ETL/BI; Snowflake intermediate, not deep platform expert |
| Domain Experience | 4/10 | No consulting background; some Snowflake via dbt |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 6/10 | Client-facing, stakeholder management; consulting skills partial |
| Seniority | 6/10 | 7+ years fits; consulting tenure gap |
| **Overall** | **5/10** | Solid data background but consulting and Snowflake depth are blockers |

## Key Gaps
- 3+ years consulting experience — **high severity** (explicit requirement; candidate is internal/customer success, not consulting)
- Deep Snowflake platform expertise — **high severity** (used via dbt, didn't architect/implement Snowflake solutions)
- AI/ML workload familiarity — **medium severity** (nice-to-have or expected for modern data platform)
- Massachusetts location — **medium severity** (James is NYC; may require relocation or heavy travel)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Prior role in consulting (Big 4, boutique, or vendor PS) with 3+ years
- Hands-on Snowflake implementation: migrations, multi-tenant design, workload optimization, security
- AI/ML pipeline or workload experience on Snowflake (or equivalent)
- Willingness to be based in or primarily serve Massachusetts

## OVERALL FIT SCORE

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills Fit | 9/10 | SQL, dbt, Python, GCP/BigQuery, data quality, CI/CD — near-perfect stack match |
| Domain Experience Fit | 5/10 | No healthcare domain. Same situation as J2 Health (scored 8.0 overall). Infrastructure-focused role reduces domain penalty. |
| Soft Skills & Culture Fit | 8/10 | Mission-driven org, collaborative, early-stage startup — all match James's preferences |
| Seniority Fit | 7/10 | James is overqualified by years (1-4 listed), but the comp ($145K-$160K) and early-stage context may make this appropriate |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **7.5/10** | Strongest technical stack match of any role evaluated. Healthcare gap is the main reducer. |
| Recency Modifier | 0 | Posting age unknown |
| Competition Modifier | 0 | Applicant count unknown |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **7.5/10** | |
| Interview Success Probability | ~50-55% | Would pass resume screen easily; healthcare gap may surface; tech depth is a clear advantage |

## GAP ANALYSIS

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Airflow (required — writing DAGs) | MODERATE | Frame: "I've worked within Airflow-based orchestration workflows at QuotaPath and I'm comfortable with orchestration concepts through CircleCI and Prefect. I'd be eager to deepen that experience with Airflow specifically." This was the J2 Health Dagster gap pattern and it worked. |
| Healthcare data domain (claims, ADT feeds) | MODERATE | Frame exactly as J2 Health cover letter: the core infrastructure problems are domain-agnostic. "Building reliable ingestion pipelines, improving data observability, reducing time from raw data to insight — these are exactly the problems I've solved at scale." |
| Experience years mismatch (1-4 listed vs. 7 actual) | MINOR | Don't mention it in cover letter. Your work speaks for itself. If asked, position it as: "I'm drawn to early-stage environments where the scope of the work matters more than the title level." |

## POSITIONING STRATEGY

**Lead Narrative:** "Data engineer who built the entire data quality function from scratch at two companies — first at Success Academy (dbt environment that grew to 1,900+ production models serving 51 schools and 18,000 users), then at QuotaPath (validation frameworks that cut incidents by 50%+). The early-stage, build-from-scratch context at Empassion is exactly the kind of environment where I work best."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. Success Academy (dbt from scratch, Airflow-adjacent migrations, healthcare-adjacent scale)
2. QuotaPath (Python pipelines, GCP/BigQuery, CI/CD, data validation)

**Skills to Highlight:** dbt Cloud (expert), SQL (expert), Python/Dask, BigQuery/GCP, data quality automation, CI/CD, data modeling, early-stage startup experience

**Note:** Apply the mission-driven modifier (+0.5) — healthcare/end-of-life care mission aligns with James's interest in mission-driven organizations (career-strategy.yaml).

## RECOMMENDATION: APPLY

Best technical fit of the new opportunities evaluated. Near-perfect stack match. Healthcare gap is the same framing challenge as J2 Health (which scored 8.0 and led to a full application). The comp is reasonable, the company stage is right, and this is a genuine chance to add Airflow/GCP production experience to the portfolio.

## COVER LETTER

To the Hiring Team at Empassion,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Engineer role at Empassion. You're looking for someone to build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers your mission: better care for advanced illness patients. That kind of foundational work, building the systems that let the rest of the organization do their jobs well, is exactly what I do best.

At Success Academy Charter Schools, I joined a data team with no formal quality process, was promoted within months to lead the function, and built the entire data quality practice from scratch: testing standards, automated monitoring, dbt models, and a BigQuery-backed warehouse that grew to 1,900+ production models serving 51 schools and 18,000 users. At QuotaPath, I designed ELT pipelines across 10+ data platforms, built Python/Dask transformation pipelines that reduced runtimes from hours to minutes, and implemented validation frameworks that cut incidents by 50%+.

My technical background aligns closely with what you've outlined. I have three years of expert-level dbt experience building test suites and maintaining documentation at scale. My Python and SQL work spans TB-scale datasets across Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. I'm well-practiced in CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions and CircleCI, and I've worked within orchestration frameworks built on CircleCI and Prefect throughout my career at QuotaPath. I'd be eager to deepen that experience with Airflow specifically.

While I haven't worked with healthcare data directly, the core infrastructure problems you've described, building reliable ingestion pipelines, improving data observability, reducing time from raw data to operational insight, are exactly the problems I've solved across SaaS and education domains at comparable scale. The mission of improving care for advanced illness patients is a genuinely compelling reason to take that work into healthcare.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience building data engineering foundations from scratch could help Empassion scale its analytics infrastructure.

Best regards,

James Mayo

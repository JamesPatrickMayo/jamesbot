## Job Summary
Staff-level data engineering role for Trust & Safety at Intuit. Requires 8+ years of big data experience with Spark, Kafka, Hive, EMR, streaming architectures, Docker/Kubernetes, and hands-on AI. Python and SQL expertise expected. Compensation: $197-266.5k, NYC Hybrid.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 3/10 | SQL expert, Python advanced; missing Spark, Kafka, Hive, EMR, streaming, Docker/K8s |
| Domain Experience | 3/10 | ETL/ELT, Redshift, dbt; no big data at Intuit scale, no Trust & Safety domain |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 5/10 | Leadership with 2 direct reports; Staff requires broader tech vision |
| Seniority | 4/10 | 7+ years but not 8+ big data; Staff implies ownership of platform direction |
| **Overall** | **3.5/10** | Stack mismatch and seniority gap |

## Key Gaps
- Spark, Kafka, Hive, EMR — **high severity** (core big data stack, no experience)
- Streaming architectures — **high severity** (explicit requirement)
- Docker/Kubernetes — **high severity** (container orchestration not in background)
- Hands-on AI — **high severity** (explicit requirement)
- 8+ years big data specifically — **medium severity** (7yr total, different focus)
- Staff-level tech vision ownership — **medium severity** (candidate has led teams but not platform strategy)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Production experience with Spark, Kafka, and streaming pipelines
- Docker/Kubernetes for data workloads
- Hands-on AI/ML pipeline or model deployment experience
- Demonstrated ownership of platform-level technical direction at scale

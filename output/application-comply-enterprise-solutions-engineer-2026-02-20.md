## OVERALL FIT SCORE

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills Fit | 7/10 | SE mechanics are strong. Technical acumen for demos/PoCs present. |
| Domain Experience Fit | 1/10 | Zero compliance/financial services background. Hard requirement, not preferred. |
| Soft Skills & Culture Fit | 8/10 | Communication, stakeholder management, client advisory all strong. |
| Seniority Fit | 7/10 | Years of experience match. Level is right. |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **5.0/10** | Strong SE motion, but the domain requirement is a hard blocker. |
| Recency Modifier | +0.5 | Posted 2 days ago |
| Competition Modifier | 0 | 33 applicants (25-100 range) |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **5.5/10** | |
| Interview Success Probability | ~10% | Would likely be screened out at resume review for lack of compliance background |

---

## GAP ANALYSIS

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Compliance/RegTech domain experience (SEC, FINRA, CFTC) | CRITICAL | No mitigation available. This is the primary hiring filter. |
| Financial institution experience | CRITICAL | No adjacent experience to reframe. SaaS RevOps is not financial compliance. |
| Regulatory framework knowledge | CRITICAL | Could learn quickly, but the JD's hard "5+ years in compliance" disqualifies without it. |

## RED FLAGS

**JD Red Flags:**
- "$110K-$120K OTE" is below market rate for an SE role in NYC that requires 5+ years domain expertise
- Financial compliance domain is extremely specific — unless James pivots deliberately toward RegTech, this is a dead end

**Candidate Red Flags:**
- Would be filtered at resume screen before reaching interviews
- The role explicitly requires compliance domain — not a "transferable skills" situation

---

## RECOMMENDATION: SKIP

The SE motion is excellent and James would excel at the pre-sales, demo, and discovery aspects of this role. However, the job description sets "5+ years in compliance or compliance-related function within a financial institution or RegTech provider" as a hard requirement, not a preference. There is no compliance, financial services, or RegTech experience in James's background.

**What would need to change:** A dedicated pivot into RegTech would require 1-2 years in a fintech or compliance-adjacent role first. This is not a near-term opportunity.

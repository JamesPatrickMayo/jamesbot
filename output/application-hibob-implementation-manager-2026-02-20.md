## THE HR KNOWLEDGE GAP — AND WHY IT'S MANAGEABLE

The JD lists "knowledge of HR" as a requirement alongside the explicit caveat that requirements aren't always the deciding factor. This matters because:

1. **The role is implementation management, not HR consulting.** HiBob is looking for someone who can own project delivery, gather requirements, configure a platform, and manage client relationships — not someone who advises on HR policy. The platform is intuitive; they want someone who'll learn it and make implementations succeed.

2. **Commission management is HR-adjacent.** QuotaPath manages sales compensation plans — calculating what employees earn, integrating with payroll/HRIS systems, and working with HR and Finance stakeholders. This isn't HRIS administration, but it's closer than most non-HR SaaS backgrounds.

3. **The pattern matches exactly.** "Gathering system requirements and business objectives from customers, assessing how best to configure the platform, providing guidance on best practices and successful deployment" — this is a sentence-for-sentence description of what James did at QuotaPath for 300+ clients per year.

## EXPERIENCE RELEVANCE

| Role | Relevance | Best Bullets |
|---|---|---|
| QuotaPath — Solutions Engineer | HIGH | "300+ client implementation projects annually, end-to-end ownership, pre-sales scoping through post-go-live support, architecture reviews, risk identification, cross-functional with AEs/CS/engineering" |
| Cision — Enterprise Account Architect | HIGH | "Led client implementations, gathered requirements, managed multi-stakeholder deployments, translated client needs into platform configurations" |
| Success Academy — Team Lead, Data Quality | MEDIUM | "Cross-functional project delivery, sprint planning, stakeholder reporting to executive leadership, risk management across multi-phase migrations" |
| ECP — Repair Support Technician | LOW-MEDIUM | "5-year track record of client advisory, technical solutions delivery, team coordination" |

## OVERALL FIT SCORE

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills Fit | 8/10 | SaaS implementation, platform configuration, risk management, cross-functional delivery — all strong |
| Domain Experience Fit | 6/10 | No direct HR/HRIS experience; comp management is the strongest adjacent angle |
| Soft Skills & Culture Fit | 9/10 | Fast-paced startup, client ownership, cross-functional collaboration, can-do approach — exceptional alignment |
| Seniority Fit | 8/10 | 3 years required; James has 7 years of implementation/SE experience at the right level |
| **Overall Fit Score** | **7.5/10** | The implementation management motion is James's strongest demonstrated skill. HR domain gap is present but explicitly acknowledged as not always a dealbreaker. |
| Recency Modifier | 0 | Unknown |
| Competition Modifier | 0 | Unknown |
| **Competition-Adjusted Score** | **7.5/10** | |
| Interview Success Probability | ~40-45% | Strong on implementation management fundamentals; HR knowledge gap manageable given JD language. Comp ($110K-$130K) is lower than some alternatives. |

---

## GAP ANALYSIS

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| HR domain knowledge | MODERATE | Frame: "I haven't administered an HRIS directly, but the core challenges of implementation, gathering requirements from HR and Finance stakeholders, configuring integrations between people data systems, and driving adoption, are exactly what I've done at scale. I'm confident I can learn HiBob's platform quickly, and I'm genuinely curious about the HR tech space." |
| Formal PM methodology (PMP, etc.) | MINOR | Not required. Jira sprint ownership and multi-phase delivery at Success Academy demonstrates the substance without the credential. |
| Spanish fluency | MINOR | Not required, only a bonus. |

## POSITIONING STRATEGY

**Lead Narrative:** "Implementation Manager who has owned end-to-end client onboarding at scale — 300+ projects annually, from pre-sales scoping through post-go-live support — at a SaaS company with complex data integration requirements. The project ownership model at HiBob is exactly the structure I worked within at QuotaPath."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. QuotaPath (scale, end-to-end ownership, cross-functional, risk management)
2. Cision / Enterprise Account Architect (multi-stakeholder implementation, requirements translation)
3. Success Academy (project planning, executive communication, delivery under pressure)

**Skills to Highlight:** End-to-end implementation ownership, requirements gathering, platform configuration, project risk management, cross-functional coordination, stakeholder communication, Jira/project tracking, SaaS environment depth

**Reframing Suggestions:**
- "300+ client onboarding projects annually" → maps directly to "lead implementation projects"
- "Scoped with AEs and CS to gather integration requirements" → maps to "gather system requirements and business objectives from customers"
- "Identified and resolved integration risks before go-live" → maps to "identify and analyze project risks and dependencies on an ongoing basis"
- "Partnered with Customer Success to scope expansion" → maps to "work cross-functionally with Sales, CS Engineers, Product, and Account teams"

---

## RED FLAGS

**JD Red Flags:**
- $110K-$130K is on the lower end for a 7-year professional with this experience profile in NYC. The pre-IPO equity partially compensates but is uncertain value.
- "Implementation Manager" is a more operationally-focused title than Solutions Engineer — it may attract more structured project managers than technical SEs, which could be an advantage for James in differentiating.

**Candidate Red Flags:**
- HR domain gap will come up. Prepare 2-3 sentences on why that gap doesn't affect the core function of this role.
- Comp floor may be lower than preferred. Confirm alignment with their range early.

---

## RECOMMENDATION: APPLY

This is the implementation-focused HiBob role that the Payroll CSA was not. The core function — owning end-to-end client implementation from point of sale through deployment — is a near-exact description of James's work at QuotaPath. The HR knowledge gap is real but the JD explicitly softens its own requirements, and the role is fundamentally about implementation management skill, not HR expertise.

The comp ($110K-$130K) is lower than some alternatives, but pre-IPO equity at a unicorn growing at triple-digit rates is meaningful upside if HiBob IPOs in the next 1-2 years.

## COVER LETTER

To the Hiring Team at HiBob,

I am writing to express my interest in the Implementation Manager role at HiBob. You're looking for someone to own client implementations end-to-end, from the first scoping conversation through to a successful deployment. That's exactly what I did at QuotaPath, at scale.

At QuotaPath, I was the single point of contact for 300+ client onboarding projects annually across 10+ CRM and financial platforms. From the pre-sales discovery call through requirements gathering, platform configuration, go-live, and post-implementation support, I owned the full lifecycle. I identified integration risks before they reached clients, documented every configuration decision and project status update, and worked daily with account executives, customer success, and engineering to keep implementations on track. My accounts retained at around 110% QoQ NRR. Before that, at Success Academy Charter Schools, I led multi-phase system migrations across 51 schools and 18,000 users, coordinating sprint planning, stakeholder reviews, and risk escalation with executive leadership during every critical business cycle.

I don't come from an HR background specifically, but I've spent my career working in software where the product touches how people are managed and paid, commission management, financial data, and CRM workflows. The core implementation challenges you've described, gathering requirements from HR and Finance stakeholders, configuring a platform to match business objectives, and driving adoption after go-live, are exactly the problems I've solved repeatedly. I'm tech-savvy, I learn platforms quickly, and I'd be genuinely engaged by what HiBob is building.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my implementation experience could help HiBob clients get up and running successfully on Bob.

Best regards,

James Mayo

## Job Summary
Specialist Solutions Architect role focused on AI tooling platforms, vector databases, RAG architectures, and AI agent infrastructure. Requires IaC (Terraform), CI/CD pipelines, security, TypeScript/Node.js, cloud-native architecture, and deep DevOps/platform engineering. Compensation: $180-247.5k, Remote/NYC.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 3/10 | Has CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Python; missing Terraform, vector DBs, RAG, TypeScript/Node.js |
| Domain Experience | 2/10 | No AI tooling, no Databricks platform, no AI agent infrastructure |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 6/10 | Strong technical communication; role is highly technical/specialist |
| Seniority | 4/10 | 7+ years but in different domain (data engineering, not AI/ML platform) |
| **Overall** | **3/10** | Core stack (IaC, AI tooling, vector DBs, RAG) largely absent |

## Key Gaps
- Terraform/IaC — **high severity** (explicit requirement, no experience)
- Vector databases, RAG, AI agent infrastructure — **high severity** (core to role)
- TypeScript/Node.js — **high severity** (required for AI tooling development)
- Databricks platform — **high severity** (employer-specific)
- Security expertise — **medium severity** (mentioned in requirements)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Hands-on experience with Terraform or equivalent IaC tools
- Production experience with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector) and RAG architectures
- TypeScript/Node.js development for AI tooling or agent frameworks
- Databricks platform certification or implementation experience

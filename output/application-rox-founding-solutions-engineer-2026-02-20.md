## COMPANY ANALYSIS

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Company** | Rox — AI-powered sales intelligence platform. Products: Research (consolidates CRM, email, calendar into account intelligence), API, Outreach (AI-driven personalized campaigns). Clients: Clay, Orbital, Dun & Bradstreet. Cashflow positive, 3x growth. |
| **Why this matters** | Rox's product is CRM data + AI agents for GTM/sales teams. This maps almost exactly to what James did at QuotaPath: CRM integration, data pipelines for sales workflows, client-facing scoping and implementation. |
| **Company stage** | Early growth (hiring founding-level SE roles in NYC and Austin simultaneously). |

## ESTIMATED FIT RATIONALE

**Why this is likely a strong fit (8.0-8.5 estimate):**

1. **"Founding" role at an AI sales intelligence company** — Rox's product is CRM-integrated, data-heavy, used by sales teams. James's QuotaPath experience (300+ onboardings, 10+ CRM platform integrations, scoping with AEs, NRR/GRR ownership) is a near-direct match.

2. **"Founding Solutions Engineer" = build from scratch** — This is James's core narrative. First SE at a company needs to define the function, create playbooks, set standards. That's exactly what James did at QuotaPath and Success Academy.

3. **Domain overlap** — Rox serves GTM/sales intelligence. QuotaPath was commission/RevOps SaaS. The data flows (CRM → pipeline → analytics), the client types (sales leaders, RevOps teams), and the integration work (Salesforce, HubSpot, data enrichment) are highly overlapping.

4. **NYC-based** — Matches geographic preference.

5. **Early-stage growth company** — Exactly the 50-500 employee range where James's profile performs best.

**Risks (to verify from full JD):**
- AI agent-specific technical requirements (may need Python API development beyond data tooling)
- Specific experience with sales intelligence data sources (Clay, Apollo, enrichment APIs) may be listed as preferred
- Salary range unknown — Rox's comp not publicly posted

## PRELIMINARY POSITIONING (to refine after full JD)

**Lead Narrative:** "The person who onboarded 300+ clients annually onto a CRM integration platform, scoped with AEs, and then went on to build the data infrastructure that made those integrations reliable. That's exactly the combination a founding SE at a sales intelligence company needs."

**Roles to Emphasize:**
1. QuotaPath (SE motion + CRM integration depth + NRR/GRR ownership)
2. Cision/Trendkite (client-facing, multi-platform, account implementation)
3. Success Academy (build from scratch credibility)

## Job Summary
Solutions Architect role focused on Retail and CPG vertical at Databricks. Requires 5+ years with >$1M ARR Retail/CPG accounts, 3+ years pre-sales, big data (Hadoop, NoSQL, OLTP/OLAP), Python/Scala/Java, and Databricks platform knowledge. Location: NYC.

## Quick Fit Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Skills | 4/10 | Python, SQL, some NoSQL; missing Scala/Java, Hadoop, Databricks |
| Domain Experience | 2/10 | No Retail/CPG; QuotaPath is B2B SaaS, not consumer retail |
| Soft Skills & Culture | 5/10 | Some pre-sales scoping with AEs; not $1M ARR account ownership |
| Seniority | 5/10 | 7+ years; domain and pre-sales tenure gaps |
| **Overall** | **3.5/10** | Vertical and platform are core to role; both missing |

## Key Gaps
- Retail/CPG domain with >$1M ARR accounts — **high severity** (core vertical requirement)
- Databricks platform — **high severity** (employer-specific, no experience)
- 3+ years pre-sales — **high severity** (candidate has scoping, not formal pre-sales)
- Big data (Hadoop, Spark) at scale — **high severity** (OLTP/OLAP, NoSQL mentioned)
- Scala/Java — **medium severity** (Python alone insufficient for some workloads)

## What Would Make This Viable
- Prior role in Retail or CPG with enterprise data/analytics (supply chain, merchandising, consumer analytics)
- Databricks certification or implementation experience
- Formal pre-sales or solutions engineering with $1M+ ARR account responsibility
- Big data stack experience (Spark, Hadoop, or equivalent) in retail/CPG context

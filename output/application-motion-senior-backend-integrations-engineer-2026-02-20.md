## RECOMMENDATION: SKIP

This is a backend software engineering role, not a solutions or data engineering role. The title says "Integrations Engineer" but the actual work is building APIs and backend services in Java or Python within a POS/retail platform. James's integration experience is at the data pipeline and client-facing configuration layer, not the backend service development layer. The domain (grocery loyalty/POS) is also completely outside James's experience.

**Note on the posting:** This is placed by a staffing firm (Motion Recruitment). The actual company is unnamed. Even if the technical fit were stronger, the 4-days-onsite requirement and staffing agency intermediary reduce the attractiveness of this opportunity.
